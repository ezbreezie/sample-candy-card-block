# Candy Card Block

Sample candy card block.


## Description

This is a custom Gutenberg "candy" card block that displays a card item with an editable candy (icon) image, header, and body content.

## Installation

1. Ideally, Step 1 will be installing and activating the [candyshop-fse](https://github.com/ezbreezie/candyshop-block-theme) theme and importing the corresponding candyshop-fse database/uploads (which are both quite small). 
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/candy-card-block` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

## Moving Forward

Some things I would do moving forward: 

1. This block definitely needs more admin CSS/functionality to allow the editing experience to act more smoothly.
2. Clean up some repetitive CSS in editor.css versus style.css
3. I'd love to spend a little more time neatly organizing the file structure to my liking
4. Always can use more customizable options!

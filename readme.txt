Sample candy card block.


== Description ==

This is a custom Gutenberg "candy" card block that displays a card item with an editable candy (icon) image, header, and body content.

== Installation ==

1. Ideally, Step 1 will be installing and activating the candyshop-fse theme and importing the candyshop-fse database/uploads (which are both quite small). 
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/candy-card-block` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Moving Forward ==

Some things I would do moving forward: 

1. This block definitely needs more admin CSS/functionality to allow the editing experience to act more smoothly.
2. Clean up some repetitive CSS in editor.css versus style.css
3. I'd love to spend a little more time neatly organizing the file structure to my liking
4. Always can use more customizable options!
